**Our goal:** Preventing marine bioinvasions and their impacts — at local, national, and continental scales.

Our network aims to:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
### Accelerate knowledge exchange and capacity building
{: .h4}
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

COMBINA creates [opportunities](/opportunities) for resource managers, scientists, and policy-makers through:

- Annual regional meeting
- Training workshops
- Student exchanges and internships

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
### Mobilize shared methods, tools, and resources across countries
{: .h4}
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

COMBINA compiles existing [resources](/resources) and works together to build new tools:

- Standardized protocols for invasion detection
- Non-native species databases and information resources
- Invasion alert system and risk prediction
- Community engagement and outreach

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
### Create a platform for coordinated research and action
{: .h4}
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

COMBINA gives our network the platform we need to:

- Advance scientific understanding of invasions dynamics across scales
- Inform management and policy decisions for effective biosecurity

### Our history

The concept for COMBINA grew from an [initial workshop](/assets/pdf/Informe-Final_Galapagos-2019-Invasions-Workshop.pdf) held in the Galápagos Islands in June 2019 with participants across 13 countries in the Americas, including scientists, policy-makers, and resource managers. The workshop underscored strong demand and need for coordination, shared resources, information exchange, and training across countries. The COMBINA network was announced at the [2023 Our Ocean Conference](http://ouroceanpanama2023.gob.pa/) in Panamá and formally launched at a [second workshop](https://stri.si.edu/story/combina), held in Panamá in March 2024 with over 70 participants from 12 different countries.
